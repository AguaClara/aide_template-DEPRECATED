    "In this design, our goal is to create a four channel design algorithms for AguaClara sedimentation tank in Python.\n",
    " \n",
    "An AguaClara channel design algorithm has already been created on MathCAD. Thus, the primary basis of our design approach is based on this original MathCAD code as well as coding tools in aide_design package. For the benefit of future design work of AguaClara team, this project is to create a model that could quickly respond to the change of design parameters like flow rate, the size of the sedimentation tanks and filter tanks etc, but also could guarantee the treatment performance at the same time.\n",

The effluent from flocculation tank comes in from the left side of inlet channel pre weir, and goes into the manifolds through the pipe shown in Figure 3. Inlet channel post weir is used to drain the poorly flocculated water when flocculation is not performing well. Exit channel pre weir is to collect the clean water from the exit launder, and effluent water overflow into post weir to get collected.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "We want to look into how the total width of the four channels will change when increasing the flow rate, our goal is to evaluate the effect of future flow rate increase on current drinking water design. In real engineering design, especially for the global South, it is critical to take cost into consideration. Ideally our design should be able to handle future flow rate as high as 60 L/s, but if the construction cost is too high, the design might not be feasible for local people. We assume that the cost of construction is proportional to the total width, and the results of our codes from different flow rate are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "( Following results are based on assumption of legitimate number of sedimentation tanks with other input variables remain all the same.)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Flow Rate (L/s) | Number of Sed Tanks | Total Width (cm)   |\n",

    "|   36  | 6| 109.3|\n",
    "|   60  | 6| 128.3|\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers above provide a rough idea about the scale of increase in total width, apparently, it doesn't go proportionally with the increase in flow rate. Thus, our suggestion for design team is that, it is feasible to appropriately increase the total width within the financial ability to accommodate future demand. However, more accurate calculation should be done using different sets of real expert inputs.\n",
