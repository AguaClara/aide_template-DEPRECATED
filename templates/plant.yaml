# This is a template to build an AguaClara water treatment plant.

# Globals that define plant-wide parameters are passed in from the gui through
# the user_parameters_dict.

# Unit processes are imported with context to provide access to the variables
# To print a unit process, include it.

# The goal is to have a filled-out set of parameters to feed to Fusion that can
# tell Fusion how to build the plant.
